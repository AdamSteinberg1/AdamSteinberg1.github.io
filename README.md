# AdamSteinberg1.github.io

This is my own personal website! It's made using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). I intended to host all my web development projects here. Right now it's very much a work-in-progess.

### Branch Organization
* `main` contains the Flutter project which is mainly Dart source code.
* `gh-pages` contains the compiled Javascript that is hosted by Github Pages. It's generated using [peanut](https://pub.dev/packages/peanut).
